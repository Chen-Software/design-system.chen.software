Introduction

Welcome to Chen's Design System, a comprehensive toolkit crafted to streamline the development of consistent, accessible, and high-performing user interfaces. This system is built on modern foundations that prioritize scalability, maintainability, and developer experience, ensuring your projects can evolve efficiently without compromising on quality.

Why PandaCSS?

At the core of our design system lies [PandaCSS](https://panda-css.com/), a CSS-in-JS framework renowned for its true zero-runtime approach. Unlike traditional CSS-in-JS solutions, PandaCSS generates static CSS during your build process, eliminating runtime overhead and ensuring optimal performance. This means your applications benefit from the flexibility of CSS-in-JSâ€”like scoped styles and dynamic themingâ€”without sacrificing load times or runtime efficiency.

Built-in Consistency with Default Presets

To accelerate development and enforce visual coherence, Chen's Design System leverages PandaCSS's default color and typography presets. These thoughtfully curated tokens provide:

* Unified Color Palette: A systematic range of colors designed for accessibility and aesthetic harmony.
* Consistent Typography: Predefined text styles and scales that ensure readability and brand alignment across all components.

By adopting these presets, we establish a shared design language out of the box, reducing redundancy and empowering teams to focus on innovation rather than reinvention.
