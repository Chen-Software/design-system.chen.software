title: Open Source Software Vetting Procedure Guidelines
---

## Introduction

Open source software offers numerous benefits, including cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and community-driven development. However, as highlighted by Ken Thompson's "Reflections on Trusting Trust" lecture, there are inherent security risks in using code not entirely created by oneself. This document outlines comprehensive guidelines for vetting open source projects to mitigate these risks while leveraging the advantages of open source software.


## Project Evaluation

### 1. Community and Maintenance

* Assess the project's community size and activity level.
* Evaluate the frequency of updates and responsiveness to issues.
* Check the number of contributors and their reputation in the open source community.

### 2. Code Quality and Security

* Review the project's coding standards and practices.
* Examine the frequency and thoroughness of code reviews.
* Assess the project's vulnerability disclosure policy and response time to security issues.

### 3. Documentation and Transparency

* Evaluate the completeness and clarity of the project's documentation.
* Check for transparent development processes and decision-making.
* Assess the availability of detailed release notes and changelogs.

## Security Measures

### 1. Code Auditing

* Conduct regular automated code scans using multiple security tools.
* Perform manual code reviews, especially for critical components.
* Engage third-party security experts for comprehensive audits of high-risk projects.

### 2. Dependency Management

* Implement a robust dependency tracking system.
* Regularly update and patch all dependencies.
* Evaluate the security practices of upstream dependencies.

### 3. Build and Deployment Security

* Verify the integrity of source code and build artifacts.
* Implement reproducible builds to ensure consistency between source and binaries.
* Use secure, multi-factor authentication for all project-related accounts.

## Governance and Compliance

### 1. License Compliance

* Ensure the project's license is compatible with your organization's policies.
* Maintain an inventory of all open source components and their licenses.
* Implement processes to manage license obligations and restrictions.

### 2. Contribution Policies

* Establish clear guidelines for contributing to open source projects.
* Implement a review process for all outgoing contributions.
* Ensure all contributions align with organizational security and intellectual property policies.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### 1. Critical Path Analysis

* Identify open source components in the critical path of your systems.
* Develop contingency plans for critical open source dependencies.
* Consider maintaining forks or internal versions of critical components.

### 2. Ongoing Monitoring

* Implement continuous monitoring of project activity and security advisories.
* Establish alerts for significant changes in project governance or maintenance.
* Regularly reassess the risk profile of each open source component in use.

## Training and Awareness

### 1. Developer Education

* Provide training on open source security best practices.
* Educate developers on the risks highlighted in Thompson's "Trusting Trust" lecture.
* Foster a culture of security awareness in open source usage and contribution.

### 2. Management Awareness

* Ensure management understands the benefits and risks of open source adoption.
* Provide regular updates on the organization's open source risk profile.
* Develop metrics to measure the effectiveness of open source vetting processes.

## Conclusion

By implementing these guidelines, organizations can harness the power of open source software while mitigating associated risks. Regular review and adaptation of these policies are crucial to address evolving threats and changes in the open source ecosystem.
